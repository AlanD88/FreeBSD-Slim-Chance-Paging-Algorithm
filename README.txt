Assignment 3 Readme File
Team: Alan Duncan, Khoa Hoang, Aryan Samuel

For this assignment we are modifying how the page replacement algorithm works in the FreeBSD OS.
More specifically we are changing the algorithm to utilize the slim chance algorithm rather than second chance.
This will directly affect the number of pages being moved around and how they are moved around.

The files included are the following:
README.txt
Design_Document_ASGN3.pdf
Writeup_ASGN3.pdf
DefaultData.csv
ModifiedData.csv

The writeup includes all our findings regarding the various performance differences between the two daemons,
and code modification details are provided in the design document.
